# Focus Group Observations For Market Analysis

## Observation 1
- **Name**: 
    - Jassell Medina Garcia
- **Observation Statement**: 
    - People seem to want an interactive map that is detailed and precise with all resources. Precise locations/ routes to buildings. 
- **Supporting Data**:
      Some Statements from Survey results:
    - "Help having clear vision of the campus and the resources"
    - "Making sure that buildings are located properly, showing walking paths and shortcuts!"
    - "A search system on the campus map, like if you searched up the 193 coffee house it would point you to the Memorial union, or even have students put in things like the turtle in the greenhouse. the campus map solves basic building finding but specific things in those buildings is harder to find."
- **Team Action (if any)**: 
    - We can focus on accuracy and precision in our app implementations.

## Observation 2

## Observation 3
- **Name**: 
    - Kiryl Filipau
- **Observation Statement**: 
    - People seem to want an option to view campus events
- **Supporting Data**: 
    - "Knowing when certain events are. For example, I constantly see tables set up on the quad but never know what they are for"
    - "Adding different campus events and where they are located on campus"
    - "News about campus events, date time etc...."
    - "Being able to know when certain events are going on around campus"
- **Team Action (if any)**: 
    - We can implement a separate tab for users that will show campus events. They can be tied to specific buildings that are part of the app. Then, those events can be shown on the map
 
## Observation 4
- **Name**: 
    - Lydia Nicolau
- **Observation Statement**: 
    - People are most interested in an interactive map that can take them to their exact desired location and give them important information to note about the building
- **Supporting Data**: 
    - "Have an interactive map where we are able to tap on locations and have pop-ups that show us what it is, including with details such as pictures and a description; and some of its perks. A GPS would be cool too."
    - "A search system on the campus map, like if you searched up the 193 coffee house it would point you to the Memorial union, or even have students put in things like the turtle in the greenhouse. the campus map solves basic building finding but specific things in those buildings is harder to find."
- **Team Action (if any)**: 
    - We should focus specifically most on making sure that the map gives users their exact location and will give them the best path to get to their desired location.

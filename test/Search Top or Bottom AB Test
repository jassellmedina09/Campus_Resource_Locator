Happiness, Engagement, Retention

Hypothesis: State your hypothesis for this A/B test
I think that putting the search bar at the bottom would be better because it's easier to tap on, but a lot of other map services have it at the top

We're trying to see which one would make our costumers happier and keep them using the app.

Based on how the metrics are, we can see the best place to place our search bar, and if it should move when clicked on, or if it should be up to each individual user

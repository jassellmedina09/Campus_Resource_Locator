INSTRUCTIONS:

In METRICS.md, for each metric, have a bullet explaining how you are collecting data for that metric in the backend. This may be data already available in Firebase (e.g. Adoption via authentication signups), or it may be code you need to add to your app (e.g. a NPS question at the end of the Golden Path with data recorded in the database for that user). This detail does not go in the HEART grid, it goes in a bulleted list after your grid in METRICS.md:

Metric 1 - how to collect
Metric 2 - how to collect
etc

Each team member should commit to the document at least one metric collection bullet (the graders will check the commits on your repo).  

yall, these are the notes from Tuesday's class where he basically gave us the answers on what to write: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAY4neSXy0CfqkCSTOsOkVaaUMzDPDYpNB4-P4DlW4M/edit

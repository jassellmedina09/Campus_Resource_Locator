# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at uricsc305@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Language To Address

### Decisions (How will they be made? Majority, consensus, other?)
-Decisions will be made through majority vote after everyone has shared 
their points of views and opinions on the decision at hand. 
### Attendance (What are your expectations for the frequency and type of attendance?; What are legitimate reasons for missing? What do missing members have to do to make up for missed meetings)
-The expectation for attendance is that all members must attend class. 
However, if a member has a valid excuse for missing class that they have 
shared in advance with the other memebers, they can be excused. Some
legitimate reasons for missing class would be illness, appointments, or
family emergencies. In order for memebers to make up for missed meetings, 
it is expected of them to reach out to their group members to understand
what was missed and how they can help.
### Assignments (How will assignments be made? How will the group deal with members who do not complete (or poorly complete assignments?)
-Assignments will be made in the project section of our Github directory. 
If someone does not complete (or poorly completes) an assignment, then they 
are expected to complete/fix their assigned work the following day. The group
will allow for two instances of missing work/poor quality work, however, on
the third instance a report will be filed to the professor. If someone is 
expressing a struggle with an assigned section ahead of time to group 
members, then the group can make a decision on further steps to take for
that section to reach completion. 
### Participation (How will you communicate and share information; How will you ensure full participation of everyone? How will you honor member strengths and interests)?
-Communication and information will be shared through Messenger. Full 
participation will be ensured through communicating what needs to get done
and then determining who is available to do it. Honoring members strengths 
and interests is important so that everyone feels comfortable completing their work.
It is important for group members to share what they are comfortable 
completing so work can be seperated accordingly. 
### Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums (How will you decide on locations and times that suit all members)?
-Meeting times and locations can be discussed by the group in class or through
Messenger. If an in person meeting is not possible, a Zoom meeting can progress.
If someone is unable to make it to an in person meeting, that person is allowed
to join through Zoom. 
### Agenda and Minutes /Notes (Who will take them how will they be shared?)
-Notes can be taken and shared by all group members. They can post the content
in Github in the decided upon folder. 
### Promptness (What do you expect and how will you handle lateness?)
-Promptness is expected of all group members. Being late happens and wont be
penalized unless someone is consistently late to class.
### Conversational Courtesies (How will the team encourage and reinforce active listening, sharing of the airtime, tangents, respectful dialogue, etc )
-After everyone has shared their thoughts and opinons it is expected that all
group members share how they feel on the information that was just presented. 
It is also expected that all members are respectful of one another and each others
thoughts and ideas. 
### Enforcement/ Feedback (How will the team enforce its own rules? How do individuals prefer to give and receive feedback?)
-If a rule is clearly being broken it is up to the members to reach out to the 
individual causing an issue privately at first. Feedback on assigned work is 
expected to be shared either in Github comments or in person.
